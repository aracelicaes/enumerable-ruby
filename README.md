# Ruby: Enumerable methods. 

Within this repository you will find an implementation of some Ruby enumerable methods. 

## Getting started
First you need to clone the repository with the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chincoya/Capstone-Sneakers-Shop
```
on your command prompt. Then, copy the enumerable.rb file into your project's directory and load it into your program using:
```ruby
require 'enumerable.rb'
```
The methods implemented are 
```ruby
#my_each
#my_each_with_index
#my_select
#my_all?
#my_any?
#my_none?
#my_count
#my_map
#my_inject
```

## Testing 

Several RSpec tests were implemented, checking regular and fringe cases, to assure functionality.
